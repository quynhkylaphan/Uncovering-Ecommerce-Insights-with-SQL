### üìä SQL Analysis & Findings

#### 1. What are the top 10 best-selling product categories?
This query identifies which product categories generate the most orders, helping the business focus marketing and inventory efforts. 

```sql
SELECT
    pc.product_category_name_english AS 'product_category',
    COUNT(oi.order_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM order_items AS oi
JOIN products AS p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN product_category AS pc ON p.product_category_name = pc.product_category_name
GROUP BY pc.product_category_name_english
ORDER BY number_of_orders DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Steps:**
* Use **JOIN** to connect three tables: `order_items` (for order data), `products` (to get the product category name), and `product_category` (to translate the category name to English).
* Use **COUNT(`oi.order_id`)** to count the total number of orders for each category.
* **GROUP BY** the English product category name to ensure the count is aggregated correctly for each unique category.
* **ORDER BY** the `number_of_orders` in descending (**DESC**) order to find the most popular categories, then use **LIMIT 10** to restrict the output to the top 10.

**Results:**

|      | product_category          | number_of_orders |
| :--- | :------------------------ | :--------------- |
| 1    | bed_bath_table            | 11115            |
| 2    | health_beauty             | 9670             |
| 3    | sports_leisure            | 8641             |
| 4    | furniture_decor           | 8334             |
| 5    | computers_accessories     | 7827             |
| 6    | housewares                | 6964             |
| 7    | watches_gifts             | 5991             |
| 8    | telephones                | 4545             |
| 9    | garden_tools              | 4347             |
| 10   | auto                      | 4235             |


**Finding & Recommendation:** The analysis reveals that products related to home and personal lifestyle are the primary drivers of sales volume. The `bed_bath_table` category is the clear leader with over 11,000 orders, followed closely by `health_beauty` and `sports_leisure`. The strong performance of these categories, along with others like `furniture_decor` and `housewares`, indicates that the core of the business is centered on items for personal and home use rather than niche or industrial products.


#### 2. What is the overall sales trend by month?
This query calculates total revenue per month to understand seasonality and growth over time.

```sql
SELECT
    strftime('%Y-%m', o.order_purchase_timestamp) AS sales_month,
    SUM(p.payment_value) AS total_revenue
FROM orders AS o
JOIN order_payments AS p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
WHERE o.order_status != 'canceled'
GROUP BY sales_month
ORDER BY sales_month;
```

**Steps:**
* Use **strftime('%Y-%m', ...)** to extract the year and month from the `order_purchase_timestamp` to aggregate sales on a monthly basis.
* **JOIN** the `orders` and `order_payments` tables on `order_id` to link sales revenue to the order date.
* Use **SUM(`p.payment_value`)** to calculate the total revenue for each month.
* Include a **WHERE** clause to exclude canceled orders from the revenue calculation.
* **GROUP BY** the `sales_month` to consolidate all sales for that month and **ORDER BY** the same column to present the results chronologically.

**Results:**

| sales_month | total_revenue      |
| :---------- | :----------------- |
| 2016-09     | 136.23             |
| 2016-10     | 53915.5            |
| 2016-12     | 19.62              |
| 2017-01     | 138119.76          |
| 2017-02     | 289081.01          |
| 2017-03     | 442406.37          |
| 2017-04     | 409846.01          |
| 2017-05     | 588529.96          |
| 2017-06     | 507302.62          |
| 2017-07     | 585331.36          |
| 2017-08     | 667224.47          |
| 2017-09     | 723781.27          |
| 2017-10     | 773104.35          |
| 2017-11     | 1187224.36         |
| 2017-12     | 874962.23          |
| 2018-01     | 1109464.0          |
| 2018-02     | 984790.19          |
| 2018-03     | 1156243.76         |
| 2018-04     | 1157336.33         |
| 2018-05     | 1149483.77         |
| 2018-06     | 1021220.02         |
| 2018-07     | 1047422.72         |
| 2018-08     | 998504.15          |
| 2018-09     | 166.46             |


**Finding & Recommendation:** The analysis of monthly revenue reveals two distinct peak sales periods, indicating significant seasonality in customer purchasing behavior.
* The November Peak: November is consistently the biggest month for sales. This could be explained by big shopping events like Black Friday and the start of the holiday season.
* The Q2 Surge: A secondary, yet very strong, sales period occurs between March and May. This three-month stretch consistently generates high revenue, suggesting it's another critical time for customer activity.

Based on the sales data, the business should adopt three strategies to maximize revenue. First, amplify marketing efforts for November, treating it as a flagship "Black November" event to fully capitalize on the year's largest sales spike. Second, create a dedicated campaign for the secondary peak season from March to May, launching promotions tailored to potential drivers like holidays or seasonal changes. Finally, to smooth out revenue flow, the company should stimulate demand during slower months with "off-season" sales and loyalty programs to keep customers engaged year-round.


#### 3. Which Brazilian states have the most customers?
This query identifies the geographic concentration of the customer base.

```sql
SELECT
    customer_state,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_unique_id) AS customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY customer_state
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Steps:**
* Use **COUNT(DISTINCT `customer_unique_id`)** to count the number of unique customers. The **DISTINCT** keyword is crucial to avoid counting the same customer multiple times if they have placed more than one order.
* **GROUP BY** `customer_state` to aggregate the customer counts for each state.
* **ORDER BY** the `customer_count` descending to find the states with the largest customer bases.

**Results:**

| State | Customer Count |
| :---- | :------------- |
| SP    | 40302          |
| RJ    | 12384          |
| MG    | 11259          |
| RS    | 5277           |
| PR    | 4882           |
| SC    | 3534           |
| BA    | 3277           |
| DF    | 2075           |
| ES    | 1964           |
| GO    | 1952           |


**Finding & Recommendation:** The business heavily relies on Brazil's Southeast region.
* Dominance of S√£o Paulo (SP): The state of S√£o Paulo accounts for over 40,000 customers. This is more than three times the count of the next leading state, demonstrating an exceptional market concentration.
* The "Big Three" Hub: Together, the three southeastern states of S√£o Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), and Minas Gerais (MG) form the backbone of the customer base, representing the vast majority of sales opportunities.

The business should adopt a regionally-focused strategy to both strengthen its core markets and explore new growth. For the dominant states of SP, RJ, and MG, the company should prioritize optimizing logistics, such as exploring partnerships with regional distribution centers to reduce shipping times and costs for the majority of its customers. For the next tier of states like RS and PR, localized marketing campaigns could be launched to increase market share. Finally, the business should investigate why the North and Northeast regions are underrepresented to identify potential barriers to entry and unlock future, untapped markets.


#### 4. What is the average time it takes for a new customer to make their second purchase?
This query analyzes customer retention by calculating how long it takes for a customer to return for a second purchase.

```sql
WITH RankedOrders AS (
    SELECT
        c.customer_unique_id,
        o.order_purchase_timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY c.customer_unique_id ORDER BY o.order_purchase_timestamp) as order_rank
    FROM orders AS o
    JOIN customers AS c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE o.order_status = 'delivered'
),
CustomerPurchaseTimes AS (
    SELECT
        customer_unique_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN order_rank = 1 THEN order_purchase_timestamp END) as first_order_date,
        MAX(CASE WHEN order_rank = 2 THEN order_purchase_timestamp END) as second_order_date
    FROM RankedOrders
    GROUP BY customer_unique_id
)
SELECT
    CEIL(AVG((strftime('%s', second_order_date) - strftime('%s', first_order_date)) / 86400.0)) as avg_days_between_purchases
FROM CustomerPurchaseTimes
WHERE second_order_date IS NOT NULL;
```

**Steps:**
* Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `RankedOrders`. Inside it, use the **ROW_NUMBER()** window function. The **PARTITION BY** `c.customer_unique_id` clause restarts the ranking for each customer, while **ORDER BY** `o.order_purchase_timestamp` sorts their orders chronologically. This assigns a rank (1, 2, 3...) to each order for every customer.
* Create a second CTE named `CustomerPurchaseTimes` that pivots the data. It uses conditional aggregation **(MAX(CASE WHEN ...) )** to get the timestamps of the 1st and 2nd orders onto a single row for each customer.
* In the final query, calculate the difference between the `second_order_date` and `first_order_date` using **strftime('%s', ...)** to convert dates to seconds. Divide by 86400.0 (seconds in a day) to get the duration in days.
* Use **AVG()** to find the average of these durations, **CEIL()** to round up the average days, filtering with **WHERE** `second_order_date` **IS NOT NULL** to only include customers who have made at least two purchases.

**Results:**

|    | avg_days_between_purchases |
| :--| :------------------------- |
| 1  | 81.0                       |

**Finding & Recommendation:** On average, customers who return for a second purchase do so after 81 days. The business should implement a targeted automated re-engagement campaign built around this 81-day cycle.  This strategy should involve sending a personalized email or push notification to first-time buyers around day 70-75, proactively reminding them of the brand and encouraging a second purchase with a compelling offer, such as a discount on items related to their initial order. The goal is to shorten this repurchase cycle and increase the overall rate of repeat customers, directly boosting customer lifetime value.


#### 5. What is the average processing time versus shipping time, and how does this vary by seller state?
This query breaks down the delivery timeline to see if delays are caused by sellers (processing) or carriers (shipping).

**Finding:** 

```sql
WITH DeliveryTimes AS (
    SELECT
        s.seller_state,
        (strftime('%s', o.order_delivered_carrier_date) - strftime('%s', o.order_approved_at)) / 86400.0 as processing_days,
        (strftime('%s', o.order_delivered_customer_date) - strftime('%s', o.order_delivered_carrier_date)) / 86400.0 as shipping_days
    FROM orders AS o
    JOIN order_items AS oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    JOIN sellers AS s ON oi.seller_id = s.seller_id
    WHERE o.order_status = 'delivered'
      AND o.order_approved_at IS NOT NULL
      AND o.order_delivered_carrier_date IS NOT NULL
      AND o.order_delivered_customer_date IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
    seller_state,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders,
    CEIL(AVG(processing_days)) as avg_processing_days,
    CEIL(AVG(shipping_days)) as avg_shipping_days
FROM DeliveryTimes
GROUP BY seller_state
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```
**Step:**
* Create a CTE named `DeliveryTimes` to prepare the data for each order.
 Inside the CTE, **JOIN** the `orders`, `order_items`, and `sellers` tables to link order timestamps to the seller's state.
* Calculate two key durations using **strftime('%s', ...)** and division by 86400.0:
	* `processing_days`: Time from order approval to carrier pickup.
	* `shipping_days`: Time from carrier pickup to customer delivery.
* In the outer query, **GROUP BY** `seller_state` to aggregate the results for each state.
* Use **AVG()** to calculate the average `processing_days` and `shipping_days`, and use **COUNT(*)** to provide context on the order volume from each state.

**Results:**

| seller_state | total_orders | avg_processing_days | avg_shipping_days |
| :----------- | :----------- | :------------------ | :---------------- |
| SP           | 78585        | 3.0                 | 9.0               |

**Finding & Recommendation:**
* Seller processing time is remarkably consistent and efficient across the country, with most states averaging a low 2-3 days to hand an order to a carrier. This indicates that sellers are largely meeting their operational targets.
* However, shipping time varies dramatically by region. While core states in the Southeast like S√£o Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) have efficient shipping times (9 days), states that are further away experience significant delays. The shipping time nearly doubles for states like Cear√° (CE) and Rond√¥nia (RO) at 15 days, and balloons to an extreme of 44 days for Amazonas (AM), highlighting that the main cause of delivery delays is the logistics and transportation network, not seller performance.

A tiered approach to carrier management is recommended. For the efficient South and Southeast regions, the current logistics partnerships should be maintained and optimized. For states with moderate delays (10-12 days), the company should renegotiate Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with carriers to improve delivery speeds. For states with severe delays (15+ days), the business should actively seek out and partner with specialized regional carriers that have stronger networks in the North and Northeast. For extreme outliers like Amazonas, establishing a regional distribution hub could be a long-term strategic investment, allowing products to be delivered to a central point before final, faster local delivery.

#### 6. Which product categories are most frequently purchased together?
This query finds which product categories are most frequently purchased together, which can inform cross-selling and product bundling strategies.


```sql
WITH CategoryPairs AS(
	SELECT
		oi1.order_id,
		pc1.product_category_name_english as category_1,
		pc2.product_category_name_english as category_2
	FROM order_items as oi1
	-- Self-join to find item pairs in the same order
	JOIN order_items AS oi2 ON oi1.order_id = oi2.order_id AND oi1.product_id < oi2.product_id
	-- Join to get the category name for the first item
	JOIN products AS p1 ON oi1.product_id = p1.product_id
	JOIN product_category AS pc1 ON p1.product_category_name = pc1.product_category_name
	-- Join to get the category name for the second item
	JOIN products AS p2 ON oi2.product_id = p2.product_id
	JOIN product_category AS pc2 ON p2.product_category_name = pc2.product_category_name
)
SELECT
	category_1,
	category_2,
	COUNT(*) AS pair_count
FROM CategoryPairs
WHERE category_1 <> category_2
GROUP BY category_1, category_2
ORDER BY pair_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Steps:**
* Create a CTE named `CategoryPairs`.
* Inside the CTE, perform a self-join on the `order_items` table. The condition `oi1.order_id = oi2.order_id` finds items in the same order, while `oi1.product_id < oi2.product_id` is a crucial trick to prevent duplicate pairs (like A-B and B-A) and self-pairs (A-A).
* **JOIN** with the `products` and `product_category` tables twice to get the English names for both items in the pair.
* In the final query, add a **WHERE** `category_1 <> category_2` clause to filter out pairs from the same category.
* Use **COUNT(*)** and **GROUP BY** `category_1` and `category_2` to count the occurrences of each unique pair.
* **ORDER BY** `pair_count` **DESC** to find the most popular combinations.

**Results:**

| Category 1            | Category 2                | Pair Count |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------ | :--------- |
| bed_bath_table        | furniture_decor           | 71         |
| furniture_decor       | bed_bath_table            | 57         |
| home_confort          | bed_bath_table            | 52         |
| furniture_decor       | garden_tools              | 39         |
| housewares            | bed_bath_table            | 27         |
| baby                  | toys                      | 25         |
| housewares            | furniture_decor           | 25         |
| garden_tools          | furniture_decor           | 21         |
| electronics           | computers_accessories     | 19         |
| garden_tools          | computers_accessories     | 19         |


**Finding & Recommendation:**
* Customers frequently purchase items from `bed_bath_table`, `furniture_decor`, `housewares`, and `garden_tools` together, indicating a "complete the home" shopping behavior.
* The analysis also identifies other logical pairings, such as `baby` products with `toys` and `electronics` with `computers_accessories`, confirming that customers often shop for related items in a single journey.

The business should implement a "Customers Also Bought" recommendation engine on its product pages; for example, a customer viewing a `bed_bath_table` item should be shown complementary products from `furniture_decor`. Furthermore, the company can create themed product bundles, such as a discounted "New Nursery" package with popular `baby` and `toys` items, or a "Home Makeover" email campaign that showcases products from all the top home-related categories to encourage larger, multi-category purchases.

# Uncovering-Ecommerce-Insights-with-SQL

## üìñ About The Project
This project involves a deep dive into the [Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?select=olist_customers_dataset.csv). The goal is to use SQL to analyze real-world e-commerce data to answer critical business questions related to sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. This repository contains the raw data and the SQL scripts used for the analysis.

### üìä SQL Analysis & Findings

#### 1. What are the top 10 best-selling product categories?
This query identifies which product categories generate the most orders, helping the business focus marketing and inventory efforts.

**Finding:** 

```sql
SELECT
    pc.product_category_name_english AS 'product_category',
    COUNT(oi.order_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM order_items AS oi
JOIN products AS p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN product_category AS pc ON p.product_category_name = pc.product_category_name
GROUP BY pc.product_category_name_english
ORDER BY number_of_orders DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Steps:**
* Use JOIN to connect three tables: order_items (for order data), products (to get the product category name), and product_category (to translate the category name to English).
* Use COUNT(oi.order_id) to count the total number of orders for each category.
* GROUP BY the English product category name to ensure the count is aggregated correctly for each unique category.
* ORDER BY the number_of_orders in descending (DESC) order to find the most popular categories, then use LIMIT 10 to restrict the output to the top 10.

**Results:**

|      | product_category          | number_of_orders |
| :--- | :------------------------ | :--------------- |
| 1    | bed_bath_table            | 11115            |
| 2    | health_beauty             | 9670             |
| 3    | sports_leisure            | 8641             |
| 4    | furniture_decor           | 8334             |

#### 2. What is the overall sales trend by month?
This query calculates total revenue per month to understand seasonality and growth over time.

**Finding:** 

```sql
SELECT
    strftime('%Y-%m', o.order_purchase_timestamp) AS sales_month,
    SUM(p.payment_value) AS total_revenue
FROM orders AS o
JOIN order_payments AS p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
WHERE o.order_status != 'canceled'
GROUP BY sales_month
ORDER BY sales_month;
```

**Steps:**
Use strftime('%Y-%m', ...) to extract the year and month from the order_purchase_timestamp to aggregate sales on a monthly basis.

JOIN the orders and order_payments tables on order_id to link sales revenue to the order date.

Use SUM(p.payment_value) to calculate the total revenue for each month.

Include a WHERE o.order_status != 'canceled' clause to exclude canceled orders from the revenue calculation, ensuring data accuracy.

GROUP BY the sales_month to consolidate all sales for that month and ORDER BY the same column to present the results chronologically.

**Results:**

| sales_month | total_revenue      |
| :---------- | :----------------- |
| 2016-09     | 136.23             |

GROUP BY customer_state
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Results:**

#### 4. What is the average time it takes for a new customer to make their second purchase?
This query analyzes customer retention by calculating how long it takes for a customer to return for a second purchase.

**Finding:** 

```sql
WITH RankedOrders AS (
    SELECT
        c.customer_unique_id,
        o.order_purchase_timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY c.customer_unique_id ORDER BY o.order_purchase_timestamp) as order_rank
    FROM orders AS o
    JOIN customers AS c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE o.order_status = 'delivered'
),
CustomerPurchaseTimes AS (
    SELECT
        customer_unique_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN order_rank = 1 THEN order_purchase_timestamp END) as first_order_date,
        MAX(CASE WHEN order_rank = 2 THEN order_purchase_timestamp END) as second_order_date
    FROM RankedOrders
    GROUP BY customer_unique_id
)
SELECT
    AVG((strftime('%s', second_order_date) - strftime('%s', first_order_date)) / 86400.0) as avg_days_between_purchases
FROM CustomerPurchaseTimes
WHERE second_order_date IS NOT NULL;
```

WITH DeliveryTimes AS (
    SELECT
        s.seller_state,
        (strftime('%s', o.order_delivered_carrier_date) - strftime('%s', o.order_approved_at)) / 86400.0 as processing_days,
        (strftime('%s', o.order_delivered_customer_date) - strftime('%s', o.order_delivered_carrier_date)) / 86400.0 as shipping_days
    FROM orders AS o
    JOIN order_items AS oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    JOIN sellers AS s ON oi.seller_id = s.seller_id

#### 6. Which product categories are most frequently purchased together?
This query finds which product categories are most frequently purchased together, which can inform cross-selling and product bundling strategies.

ITH CategoryPairs AS(
	SELECT
		oi1.order_id,
		pc1.product_category_name_english as category_1,
		pc2.product_category_name_english as category_2
	FROM order_items as oi1
	-- Self-join to find item pairs in the same order
	JOIN order_items AS oi2 ON oi1.order_id = oi2.order_id AND oi1.product_id < oi2.product_id
	-- Join to get the category name for the first item
	JOIN products AS p1 ON oi1.product_id = p1.product_id
	JOIN product_category AS pc1 ON p1.product_category_name = pc1.product_category_name
	-- Join to get the category name for the second item

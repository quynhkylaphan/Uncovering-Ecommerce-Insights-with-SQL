## üìñ About The Project
This project involves a deep dive into the [Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?select=olist_customers_dataset.csv). The goal is to use SQL to analyze real-world e-commerce data to answer critical business questions related to sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. This repository contains the raw data and the SQL scripts used for the analysis.

### üìä SQL Analysis & Findings

#### 1. What are the top 10 best-selling product categories?
This query identifies which product categories generate the most orders, helping the business focus marketing and inventory efforts.

**Finding:** 

```sql
SELECT
    pc.product_category_name_english AS 'product_category',
    COUNT(oi.order_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM order_items AS oi
JOIN products AS p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN product_category AS pc ON p.product_category_name = pc.product_category_name
GROUP BY pc.product_category_name_english
ORDER BY number_of_orders DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Results:**

### üìä SQL Analysis & Findings

#### 1. Top 10 Best-Selling Product Categories
This query identifies which product categories generate the most orders, helping the business focus marketing and inventory efforts.

**Finding:** 

```sql
SELECT
    pc.product_category_name_english AS 'product_category',
    COUNT(oi.order_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM order_items AS oi
JOIN products AS p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN product_category AS pc ON p.product_category_name = pc.product_category_name
GROUP BY pc.product_category_name_english
ORDER BY number_of_orders DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Results:**
